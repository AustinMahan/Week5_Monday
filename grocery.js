//1. Add groceries to <ul>. Store status, price and quantity as data attributes

//2. Give 'needed' items a background-color of your choosing. Do the same for 'complete' items.
//   Choose any text color you desire.

//3. Display the item quantity next to it's name. (  i.e. Tomatoes (5)  )

//4. Display total quantity and cost on the page.

//5. When an item is hovered over, it's background should darken slightly. This can be done through CSS but use
//   JS for practice.

//6. When and item is double-clicked, give it the class 'selected' and have it's background remain slightly darkened.

//7. When 'Remove Item' is clicked, delete the item from the list. Have the item .fadeOut()

//8. When 'Add item' is clicked, a new item should be added to the list. 'Status' should default as 'needed'.

//9. ** Have total quantity and cost update when items are added or removed!
